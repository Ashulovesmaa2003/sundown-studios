## Getting Started  

This project is designed to be run on **Daytona**, a powerful tool for testing and deploying applications in cloud containers, removing the need for local environment setup.  

### Running with Daytona  

1. **Start Daytona Server**  
   Open your terminal and start the Daytona daemon server with:  
   
bash  
   daytona server  
  
2. **Create the Workspace**  
   Use Daytona to clone and set up the project directly in a cloud container:  
   
bash  
   daytona create https://github.com/AshutoshSAccess the Applicatione.git  
  
3. **Access the Application**  
   Once Daytona has completed the setup, open your browser and visit:  
   
 
   http://localhost:8080  
  
   The application will be up and running without any local dependencies!  

### Optional: Running Locally
